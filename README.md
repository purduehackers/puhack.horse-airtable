A super simple serverless Airtable-based link shortener. Now running on âœ¨ THE EDGE ðŸ•³

This project used to be called `abls-serverless`, but I thought it would be cool to rewrite it to use Edge Functions instead. [I copied the code almost entirely from @lachlanjc](https://github.com/lachlanjc/abls-edge), who wrote an Edge Function-powered Airtable-based link shortener adapted from my `abls-serverless` project.

## Try it!
